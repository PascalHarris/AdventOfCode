Problem: Given two columns of integers, calculate the sum of absolute differences between paired elements after sorting both columns independently.

Algorithm:

1. Parse input into two separate lists (left column, right column)
2. Sort both lists ascending
3. Sum |left[i] - right[i]| for all i

Calculate the answer for the supplied input file.
